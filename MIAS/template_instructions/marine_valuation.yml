    You are a careful research assistant. Given a TOPIC and CONTEXT snippets from a PDF,
    rate how relevant the PDF is to the topic on a 0–100 scale using the rubric:

      - 90–100: Directly about the topic; multiple strong matches in methods, results, or discussion.
      - 75–89: Substantially related; at least one section (methods or results) is clearly on-topic.
      - 50–74: Partially related; the topic appears but is tangential, limited, or only in background/context.
      - 25–49: Weakly related; only brief or generic mention without substantive analysis.
      - 0–24: Not related to the topic.

    Rules:
    - Do not default to round numbers; calibrate carefully to the evidence in the context.
    - Consider both the scientific content (methods, data, results) and the economic valuation aspects.
    - When the topic is marine alien species, do NOT treat general biodiversity, general pollution,
      or generic ecosystem services as strongly related unless alien species and valuation are explicit.

    Output format:
    Return ONLY valid JSON with keys:
      - relevance_percentage: integer 0..100
      - rationale: short string (one or two sentences) explaining the score

global_extraction:
  system_prompt: |-
    Extract bibliographic and study fields from the CONTEXT. The documents are primarily about
    the economic valuation of impacts from marine alien (non-indigenous) species, but you must
    not assume information that is not in the text.

    Rules:
    - If a field is not present, write exactly "N/A".
    - If multiple values exist for a field (e.g. several authors or species), join them with "; ".
    - Keep outputs compact and machine-readable.
    - Do not invent coordinates, distances, years, or numeric estimates.

    Return a flat JSON object with the following keys (all as strings):

      author                 : main authors (e.g. "Surname1, Name1; Surname2, Name2")
      year                   : publication year (YYYY) if available, else "N/A"
      title                  : article title
      journal                : journal or outlet name
      country                : country or countries of the study site(s)
      spatial coordinates    : coordinates for the site(s)
      distance coast         : distance from coast, in meters
      protected area         : "1" if explicitly within a marine protected area, "0" otherwise
      number of marine alien species : number of alien species in the valuation
      marine alien species   : list of the alien species involved
      respondent             : main respondent group (resident, tourist, fisher, etc.)
      sample size            : sample size of respondents
      type of sample         : sampling design (random, stratified, convenience, etc.)
      survey mode            : mode of survey (online, mail, telephone, face to face, mixed)
      type of study          : economic study type (contingent valuation, choice experiment, costs, etc.)
      single site/multiple site : "1" if a travel-cost multiple-sites study, "0" otherwise
      CVM_elicitation        : "1" if CVM used AND elicitation format is stated; "0" otherwise
      metrics                : welfare metric (WTP, WTA, CS, or N/A)
      year of estimate       : year/base year of economic estimate (YYYY)
      u.m. estimate          : unit of measure (e.g. "EUR/person", "EUR/visit")
      estimate               : central numeric estimate (without unit)
      description            : 1–2 sentences describing the environmental change valued
      note                   : any short clarifying note

    If the CONTEXT is clearly off-topic, still do your best to extract generic bibliographic
    information (author, year, title, journal) and set other fields to "N/A".

fields:

  country:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: identify the country or countries of the study site(s).

      Rules:
      - Extract only explicit site countries; do NOT infer from author affiliations or institutional addresses.
      - If multiple countries are stated, list them separated by "; ".
      - If only a broad region is given (e.g. "Mediterranean Basin"), output that literal region.
      - If many countries are clearly involved but not fully listed, return "multicountries".
      - If no country or region is stated, return "N/A".

      Output: a single line string.

  spatial coordinates:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: extract geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) for the study site(s).

      Rules:
      - Prefer decimal degrees; if values are given in degrees/minutes/seconds (DMS), convert to decimal
        with 5 decimal places if the exact conversion is possible.
      - If multiple sites are present, list coordinate pairs as "lat,lon" separated by " | ".
      - If coordinates appear only in figures without explicit numeric values, return "N/A".
      - Do NOT invent or approximate coordinates.

      Output example:
      - "45.43700,12.33300 | 45.51000,12.30000"
      - or "N/A".

  distance coast:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: extract the distance from the coast (in meters) if explicitly reported.

      Rules:
      - If the value is reported in kilometres, convert to meters (e.g. 1.2 km -> 1200).
      - If a range is given, return the midpoint (arithmetic mean).
      - If the distance is not explicitly stated, return "N/A".
      - Do NOT infer from maps or figures without numeric labels.

      Output: numeric string (e.g., "1200") or "N/A".

  protected area:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: determine whether the main study site is inside a Marine Protected Area (MPA).

      Rules:
      - Return "1" if the text explicitly states the site is within an MPA, marine reserve,
        national park, or similar protected designation.
      - Return "0" if the text states it is not in an MPA, or if there is no information.
      - Do not infer from general context (for example, do not assume all national parks
        are MPAs unless stated).

      Output: "1" or "0".

  number of marine alien species:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: extract the number of marine alien (non-indigenous) species that the economic
      estimate refers to.

      Rules:
      - Extract a clear integer count if it is explicitly reported.
      - If several alien species are listed explicitly, you may count them.
      - If the number is ambiguous or never clearly stated, return "N/A".
      - If the valuation is clearly not about alien species, return "N/A".

      Output: integer as string (e.g. "3"), or "N/A".

  marine alien species:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: list the names of the marine alien species involved in the valuation.

      Rules:
      - Use binomial scientific names when given; otherwise use the exact names reported.
      - Separate multiple species with "; ".
      - If only higher taxa or vague categories (e.g. "invasive algae") are mentioned without
        specific species names, return "N/A".
      - If the study clearly has no alien species, return "N/A".

      Output examples:
      - "Rugulopteryx okamurae; Callinectes sapidus"
      - or "N/A".

  respondent:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: identify the main respondent group if there is a survey (e.g. resident, tourist,
      fisher, bather, sailor, diver, etc.).

      Rules:
      - If the study does not use a survey of human respondents, return "N/A".
      - Prefer the exact label used by the authors (lowercase single term or short phrase).
      - If multiple groups are clearly present, you may list them separated by "; " but be concise.

      Output: one term or short phrase, or "N/A".

  sample size:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: extract the sample size of respondents.

      Rules:
      - Return a single integer (as a string).
      - If there are several waves or sub-samples, return the total sample size if it is reported;
        otherwise return the main sample size used for the economic estimation.
      - If the sample size is not reported, return "N/A".

      Output: integer as string (e.g. "428") or "N/A".

  type of sample:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: identify the sampling design.

      Rules:
      - Choose one of:
          "random", "stratified", "cluster", "systematic", "convenience", "snowball", "other", "N/A".
      - If several designs are combined, pick the primary one used for estimation.
      - If the design is vague (e.g. "survey of visitors" without further detail), use "convenience"
        if it appears non-probability; otherwise "N/A".

      Output: one token from the list.

  survey mode:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: identify the primary survey mode.

      Rules:
      - Choose one of:
          "online", "mail", "telephone", "face to face", "mixed", "N/A".

          "hedonic pricing", "travel cost model", "production functions",
          "benefit transfer", "other", "N/A".
      - "Choice model" and "choice experiment" can be used interchangeably; prefer
        "choice experiment" if that term is explicit.
      - If the study is purely a cost accounting or damage cost calculation, use "costs".
      - If none of the categories clearly applies, use "other" or "N/A".

  single site/multiple site:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: indicate whether this is a travel-cost multiple-sites study.

      Rules:
      - Return "1" only if a travel cost model (TCM) with multiple sites is used.
      - Return "0" for all other cases, including:
          * single-site TCM
          * non-TCM valuation methods
          * unclear cases.

      Task: identify the welfare metric reported.

      Rules:
      - Choose one of:
          "WTP", "WTA", "CS", "N/A".
      - "WTP" = willingness to pay; "WTA" = willingness to accept;
        "CS" = consumer surplus (e.g., from travel cost models).
      - If multiple metrics are reported, choose the one used in the main conclusions.
      - If no clear welfare metric is identifiable, return "N/A".

      Output: one token from the list.

  year of estimate:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: extract the year (or base year) of the economic estimate, which may differ
      from the publication year.

      Rules:
      - Look for explicit mention such as "values are expressed in 2015 euros" or
        "prices were converted to 2010 values".

      Output: YYYY or "N/A".

  u.m. estimate:
    evidence: true
    question: |-
      Task: extract the unit of measure of the main economic estimate.

      Rules:
      - Examples:
          "EUR/person", "EUR/household", "EUR/visit", "EUR/hectare", "EUR/year".
      - Use singular (e.g. "EUR/person", not "EUR/persons").
      - If multiple units appear, choose the one corresponding to the central result.
      - If no clear unit is associated with the main estimate, return "N/A".

      Output: normalized unit string or "N/A".

    question: |-
      Task: extract the central numeric estimate of economic value.

      Rules:
      - If several estimates exist, choose the main or central estimate used in the conclusions.
      - Return only the numeric value (no currency symbol and no unit).
      - If only a range is given, return the midpoint.
      - Replace commas as thousand separators, but keep decimal points.
