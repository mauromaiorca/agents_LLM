analysis_goal: >
  Improve the YAML profile for economic valuation of impacts from marine alien
  species, so that future extractions are more complete, consistent, and discriminant,
  especially for relevance scores and economic fields.

relevance_analysis: >
  If relevance or relevance_percentage are flat (e.g. all 0 or all 1, or variance
  is very low), propose stricter and more discriminant relevance rules in the
  YAML profile, possibly by tightening conditions on the presence of both alien
  species and economic valuation content.

missingness_analysis: >
  For columns with a high proportion of "N/A", decide whether the problem is
  due to the prompt being too vague, the field definition being too ambitious,
  or the information simply not existing in most papers. Propose either better,
  more precise questions, or removal/renaming of fields.

plausibility_checks: >
  Identify systematically implausible values (e.g., non-numeric estimate,
  currencies mixed inside numeric fields, years out of plausible range,
  units inconsistent with the metric) and introduce clearer formatting rules
  in the YAML prompts. Separate value, currency, and unit whenever it helps.

multi_estimate_handling: >
  If multiple estimates per article appear in the CSV (e.g. repeated pdf_filename
  rows or hints in description), propose a schema that can represent multiple
  valuation estimates per study, with structured sub-fields if needed.

constraints: >
  The new YAML must remain a single profile file compatible with the existing
  pipeline structure (profile_name, description, topic, schema_fields,
  evidence_exclude, relevance, global_extraction, fields). Changes must be
  backward-compatible enough that the pipeline can be adapted with minimal effort.
